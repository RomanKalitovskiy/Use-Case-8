User
  I have a react app with redux store.
  after user submits the form, i am setting some values to the store. How can i then log into console data stored in the redux store?

  To log data stored in your Redux store after a user submits a form, you can make use of Redux middleware. Middleware lets you run side-effects, like logging, in response to dispatched actions. Here's a step-by-step guide:

  1. **Create a Middleware for Logging:**
    
    You can create a middleware that logs the state of the store whenever an action is dispatched. Here's a simple logging middleware:
    
    ```javascript
    const loggerMiddleware = store => next => action => {
        let result = next(action); // dispatch the action
        console.log('current state', store.getState()); // log the updated state
        return result;
    };
    ```

  2. **Apply the Middleware to the Store:**
    
    You'd need to use `applyMiddleware` from Redux to add your logger middleware to your store. If you have other middlewares, you can chain them using `applyMiddleware`.
    
    ```javascript
    import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
    import rootReducer from './reducers';

    const store = createStore(
        rootReducer,
        applyMiddleware(
            loggerMiddleware,
            // ... other middlewares
        )
    );
    ```

  3. **Dispatch the Action from the Form Submission Handler:**

    In your form submission handler, you'd dispatch an action to the Redux store to update the state:

    ```javascript
    const handleSubmit = (formData) => {
        // Dispatch an action
        store.dispatch({ type: 'FORM_SUBMITTED', payload: formData });
    };
    ```

    When the `FORM_SUBMITTED` action is dispatched, the logger middleware will intercept it and log the updated state to the console.

  4. **(Optional) Conditional Logging:**

    If you want to log the state only when a specific action (e.g., `FORM_SUBMITTED`) is dispatched, you can add a conditional check in your logger middleware:

    ```javascript
    const loggerMiddleware = store => next => action => {
        let result = next(action); // dispatch the action
        if (action.type === 'FORM_SUBMITTED') {
            console.log('current state after form submission', store.getState());
        }
        return result;
    };
    ```

  5. **DevTools Extension (Recommended for Development):**

    If you're developing and debugging, it's beneficial to use the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). It's a browser extension that provides a powerful interface for inspecting, replaying, and debugging dispatched actions and state changes. Once installed and properly set up with your store, you can view all state changes in a more visual interface, which can be even more informative than simple console logging.

  Remember, if you choose to use a logging middleware, you might want to remove or disable it in production to avoid unnecessary performance overhead and potential information exposure.
